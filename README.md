Project Motivation
As a dedicated movie and TV show admirer myself, I wanted to get a deeper understanding of patterns within some of the most popular movies globally. Can we identify certain metrics that will make a movie an almost guaranteed success? What role does popularity or the genres play? During times of peak movie franchises, how do prequels or sequels of a movie factor into the overall success? I am going to answer these and more questions in this project but will focus on two main issues:

File Description
This projects includes one Jupyter notebook with all code required for analyzing the data and creating a supervised machine learning algorithm. The csv file train.csv contains 5,000 movies with 16 variables as the training data set for the algorithm. The csv file tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits contains the test data with 5000 movies and 16 variables.

Which variables are particularly predictive of absolute revenue figures?
popularity
budget
runtime
